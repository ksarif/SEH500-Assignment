## Note about AI Usage
We wrote our daily medication reminder code first, but then quickly realized that for the purposes of testing, and showing off our project, we needed a version that would go off more frequently.
Instead of re-writing the code, we simply asked AI to generate a version that would go off more frequently.  So to a certain extent, the test version that goes off every minute could be considered entirely AI 
generated.  That being said, our daily version was written mostly by hand with some help from AI.  We have included comments in the code to show which parts were AI generated.  We included our testing version for
completeness, and for your ease of use as well, but to be clear, out main assignment is the daily version.
